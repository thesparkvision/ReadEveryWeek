# ReadEveryWeek
Making a personal reading recommender plus blogs account to read more and gamify the experience.
A personal reading system for people who read to think.

This project helps you capture articles, read them deeply, mark what truly mattered,
and reflect on how your reading shapes your thinking over time.

It is:
- Single-user
- Private by default
- Sheet-first
- AI-optional
- Calm by design

This is not a social product, a feed, or a content platform.

## Why this exists

Most read-later tools solve storage.
Very few help you understand *why* something mattered or *how* it changed you.

This project treats reading as a thinking process, not a queue.

## Core principles

### Sheet-first data
A spreadsheet is always a valid representation of your data.
You can see everything, edit everything, and leave anytime.

Databases are optimizations — never dependencies.

### Favorites are signals
Marking something as a Favorite is intentional.
Favorites carry reasons, engagement, and meaning.
All reflection and AI features are anchored to Favorites.

### AI is optional and assistive
AI can summarize, ask questions, and surface patterns.
It never blocks core usage and can be disabled entirely.

### No feeds, no followers
This is a private system.
There are no likes, shares, or engagement pressure.

## Core loop

Capture → Read → Mark → Revisit → Reflect

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Doc → Sheet → Recommendations

### Phase 2 — Reading Interface
Mobile-first web reader with navigation and notes.

### Phase 3 — Persistence & Deployment
Database as an enhancement, Sheet always supported.

### Phase 4 — Mobile App
Thin client over the same API.

### Phase 5 — Intelligence & Reflection

## Who this is for
