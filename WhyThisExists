## Why this exists

I don’t struggle to find things to read.
I struggle to remember what shaped me.
I have lot of things to read but the current tools are too overwhelming and I don't read at all or I read too much.
I want to keep reading new things and make it a habit.

Most tools help me save articles.
Almost none help me understand why I saved them,
why I reread some,
and why others quietly disappeared.

I want a system that:
- Respects long-form thinking
- Lets me explain why something mattered
- Shows patterns over years, not days
- Helps me form habits and read more and consistently.

Long Term Vision:
I will be building more tools and the plan is to sync them all to extract meaning about myself - form a system that is built to help me know that I am progressing year by year, month by month, week by week - that I am bettering myself.
